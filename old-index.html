   <p>Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
       (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
       traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
      In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>

   <p>A salad is a dish consisting of mixed, mostly natural ingredients.
       They are typically served chilled or at room temperature, though some can be served warm.
        Condiments and salad dressings, which exist in a variety of flavors, are often used to enhance a salad.</p>

   <h5>winter</h5>
   <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. 
      It occurs after autumn and before spring. 
      The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun.
       Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</p>

<p>Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water.
    The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake).
     Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.
      In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay.
       A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.[2]
   Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke.
   [3] There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.
   [4] Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.</p>
